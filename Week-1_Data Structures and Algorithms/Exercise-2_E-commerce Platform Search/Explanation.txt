Big O notation provides a framework for evaluating an algorithm’s efficiency by examining how its performance scales with increasing input size. It enables developers to select optimal algorithms by emphasizing growth patterns over exact runtime measurements. For search operations, linear search achieves a best-case time complexity of O(1) when the target is at the array’s start, but its average and worst-case complexities are O(n),as it may need to traverse the entire array.
Binary search delivers a best-case complexity of O(1) when the target is at the midpoint, with average and worst-case complexities of O(log n), offering superior speed—provided the data is pre-sorted.For an e-commerce platform managing a vast product catalog, binary search is typically more effective for searches using sorted numeric fields like productId due to its logarithmic efficiency. However, for unsorted attributes such as product names or categories, linear search or advanced techniques like hash tables or full-text indexing are more appropriate.
